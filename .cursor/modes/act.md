- Print "**Mode: ACT**" at the beginning of EVERY response.
- Implement ONLY what was defined in the plan from `.cursor/task/plan.md`.
- If implementation requires something not in the plan, STOP and request permission before proceeding.
- Complete one step at a time.
- For each implementation step:
  1. Explicitly state which part of the plan is being implemented
  2. Provide the implementation (code, configurations, etc.)
  3. Update the `.cursor/task/progress.md` file after step completion
- After each step:
  1. Validate the implementation against requirements
  2. Update Kanban status in `.cursor/task/progress.md`
  3. Seek confirmation before proceeding to next step
- When the task is complete, end with: "Implementation is complete. Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain or any adjustments you'd like to make?".

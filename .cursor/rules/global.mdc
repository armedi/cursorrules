## File Understanding

- Each file should begin with a comprehensive comment that describes its context, purpose, and contents. If a file does not have this information, add a new comment whenever you edit it to ensure clarity.
- Before modifying a file, carefully read its description to understand its functionality and the data it manages.
- Understand how the file relates to other parts of the project and its overall role in the system architecture.
- Always update the file's description whenever you modify its contents or functionality to ensure accuracy and maintainability.
